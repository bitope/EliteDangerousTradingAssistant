Elite Dangerous Trading Assistant

This tool assists Commanders with plotting out profitable trade routes in the PC game Elite: Dangerous, currently in Beta.

If you downloaded the entire Git, or are unsure where to go in this Git for the latest release, see the Releases folder. Download the .zip for the latest release. It is pre-compiled. The source code is for those that wish to set up their own project within Visual Studio and modify the application and/or compile their own copy.

Features:

*Collect data about commodities available in different star systems and stations.

*Adviser will determine all profitable trades. Trade data for commodities is available and can be sorted and filtered.

*Adviser will determine optimal manifests between systems. A manifest is a collection of trades and is optimized based
on the supply of the commodity, the Commander's available capital to invest, and the number of free cargo holds the
Commander has.

*Adviser will plot trade routes based on manifest data. A full route is a circuit of manifests starting and ending at
the same system and station. The key metric to the routes is Average Profit per Trip.
